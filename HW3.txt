1. 
	a. One person owns only one social security number, and that one SSN can only have one owner.
	b. One pet can only have one owner, but one owner can have many pets.
	c. A group of (many) students can have more than one classes, and a group of (many) classes have more than one students in them.
2.
	a. A transaction is a weak entity to an account. 
	b. You would merge information that already corresponds with one another and therefore will create many unecessary duplicates.
	c.
3. Assuming you have a ternary relationship with a professor, textbook, and course. These are all connected, as they all use each other. A professor uses a course and a textbook to teach,
a course uses a professor and a textbook to exist, and a textbook uses a course and a professor to be part of the course. 
Design 2 cannot handle a situation when multiple textbooks are ordered for the same course by different professors. You will not be able to uniquely identify what textbook is ordered by which
specific professor for that course. Connecting A and C in the binary relationships would solve this probkem because a professor can have a direct connection to the textbook they ordered, 
and the textbook can have an attribute that shows what teacher ordered the textbook.

5. An example of the generalization of entities is a faculty member and a student being part of the person generalization.
A faculty member is a person and so is a student. This is an overlapping generalization because a supertype (person) can be a member of multiple subtypes (both
a student and a faculty member). For example, a student can be a grader or a TA.
