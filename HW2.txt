1. select distinct building from (  
select building, room_number, course_id, count(*) as counter
from section  
group by building, room_number, course_id) 
where counter >=3;

2. Gap: select avg(salary) - (sum(salary)/count(*)) from instructor;
Missing value: select * from instructor
where salary is null;

The reason why the gap exists is because of a tuple having a null value for the salary.
This tuple is included in the count(*) statement but excluded in avg(salary).
